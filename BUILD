[info]
we are using gnu make for our code because it contain
many tools working togather to build this project

not Cmake because it is optimized for cpp and c projects
but our projects use c as primary language and many
other assembler languages are used like gas, nasm, masm

there is no metabuild system in this project like cmake, meason etc
so we need to manage our own dependency

we need cross gcc compiler to build but it not should include c standard user libreary
but must include compiler header like stdint and more
