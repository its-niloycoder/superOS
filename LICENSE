Hi, my name is Niloy. I'm writing this code for fun and to learn.
No need to seek permission to work with it.

In reality, nothing is truly free in the universe. You need
at least an internet connection or a storage device, both of which aren't free.
Even though this code is open source, itâ€™s still dependent on resources with costs.

The open-source community is tightly connected. For example,
modern Linux has incorporated many ideas from the older BSD systems,
while BSD has also adopted some concepts from Linux over time.

Mac OS users should pay for their experience, which might make them feel special.
Meanwhile, Windows users can just enjoy that it "just works."
